## This is Bo-E

Bo-E is a 3d printed ROS robot originally made to use all my spare parts.

However, after putting effort into designing Bo-E, I started to love the project and bot. As a result, commpomnents were upgraded and a lot more time was invested into the look and operation of the bot.

One of the main features of Bo-E is the forward facing screen. This reposity contains the javascript side code that operates a "face" on said screen.

The eventual goals of Bo-E's eyes is to:
- Show "emotion"
- Maintain fluid animations
- Track faces


I'm already really happy with the little details put into the eye animations (shown below), but a lot more needs to be done before Bo-E's eyes are declared "done". That is, if they ever are.
